Enter into terminal: curl http://localhost:14151/primesStored
Output should be nothing

*Test for stored primes after a non prime with isPrime is used
Enter into terminal  : curl http://localhost:14151/isPrime/4
		then : curl http://localhost:14151/primesStored
Output should still be nothing

*Test for stored primes after a prime with isPrime is used
Enter into terminal  : curl http://localhost:14151/isPrime/7
		then : curl http://localhost:14151/primesStored
Output should be 7

*Test for stored primes after a two primes are used with isPrime
Enter into terminal  : curl http://localhost:14151/isPrime/7
Enter into terminal  : curl http://localhost:14151/isPrime/13
		then : curl http://localhost:14151/primesStored
Output should be 13 7
